# MVP Training Status

## ‚úÖ MVP Training is NOW RUNNING!

**Started:** Just now
**Expected completion:** 30-60 minutes
**Configuration:** MVP (minimal for CPU testing)

---

## What's Happening Right Now

The training process is actively running in the background and generating self-play games for the first iteration.

**Current process:**
```
Process ID: 541698
CPU Usage: 103% (actively training)
Status: Generating self-play games (2 games with 25 MCTS simulations each)
```

**Progress:**
- Iteration 1 of 5 - IN PROGRESS (generating games)
- Each iteration takes ~5-10 minutes
- Total time: 30-60 minutes

---

## What Will Happen

### Iteration 1 (in progress):
1. ‚úì Initialize model (DONE)
2. ‚è≥ Generate 2 self-play games (IN PROGRESS - takes ~5 min)
3. ‚è≥ Train neural network on those games
4. ‚è≥ Evaluate new model vs old model (4 games)
5. ‚è≥ Save checkpoint

### Iterations 2-5:
Same process, gradually improving the model

---

## Monitoring Progress

You can check progress anytime with:

```bash
# View training log
tail -50 mvp_training.log

# Check if still running
ps aux | grep train_main

# Follow log in real-time (when it starts outputting)
tail -f mvp_training.log
```

**Note:** Output is buffered, so you might not see anything for the first few minutes. This is normal!

---

## What You Should See When It Completes

After 30-60 minutes, you should see output like this:

```
======================================================================
ITERATION 1
======================================================================

[1/5] Generating self-play games...
   Generated 2 games (10 games/sec, 80 total positions)
   Replay buffer: 80 positions

[2/5] Training neural network...
   Trained on 80 positions
   Total loss: 2.3456
   Policy loss: 1.2345
   Value loss: 1.1111

[3/5] Evaluating new model...
   Evaluated 4/4 games (win rate: 50.0%)
   Final: 2W 2L 0D (win rate: 50.0%)

[4/5] Updating best model...
   ‚úó New model only wins 50.0%. Keeping old model.

[5/5] Saving checkpoint...
   Saved checkpoint: checkpoints_mvp/checkpoint_iter_2.pt
   Saved best model: checkpoints_mvp/best_model.pt

======================================================================
ITERATION 1 COMPLETE (327.5s)
======================================================================
Total games: 2
Total positions: 80
Win rate: 50.0%
Policy loss: 1.2345
Value loss: 1.1111
Total loss: 2.3456
Learning rate: 0.001000
======================================================================
```

This will repeat 5 times.

## Success Criteria

**The MVP training is successful if:**

- ‚úÖ All 5 iterations complete without errors
- ‚úÖ No NaN or infinity in loss values
- ‚úÖ Checkpoints are saved successfully
- ‚úÖ Loss values decrease over iterations (at least somewhat)
- ‚úÖ No crashes or memory errors
- ‚úÖ Process completes in reasonable time (30-90 min)

**If all criteria met ‚Üí You're safe to rent a GPU!** üéâ

## What Happens After MVP Completes

### If Successful (Expected):
1. ‚úÖ You've verified the entire pipeline works end-to-end
2. ‚úÖ No bugs in training code
3. ‚úÖ Checkpoints save/load correctly
4. ‚úÖ You're 95% safe to rent a GPU
5. ‚û°Ô∏è Next step: Rent a cheap GPU and do a small test (10 iterations, $0.50-1)

### If Failed (Unlikely):
1. ‚ùå Review error messages in mvp_training.log
2. ‚ùå Fix any bugs found
3. ‚ùå Run MVP again
4. ‚ùå DO NOT rent a GPU yet!

## Timeline

**Estimated completion times:**

| Stage | Time | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Iteration 1 | 5-10 min | ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS |
| Iteration 2 | 5-10 min | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Iteration 3 | 5-10 min | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Iteration 4 | 5-10 min | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Iteration 5 | 5-10 min | ‚è≥ Pending |
| **Total** | **30-60 min** | **‚è≥ Running** |

---

## After MVP: Next Steps

### 1. Review Results
```bash
# Check the log
cat mvp_training.log

# Look for checkpoints
ls -lh checkpoints_mvp/
```

### 2. If Successful ‚Üí Plan GPU Training

**Option A: Conservative (Recommended)**
- Rent RTX 3090 on Vast.ai ($0.15/hr)
- Run 500 iterations (~$20-30)
- Test the model
- Decide if you want to continue to 1000

**Option B: Ambitious**
- Rent RTX 4090 on RunPod ($0.34/hr)
- Run 1000 iterations right away (~$40-60)
- Get a strong model

**Option C: Incremental (Safest)**
- Rent cheap GPU
- Run 10 iterations to test GPU works ($0.50-1)
- Then run 100 iterations ($3-5)
- Then run 500 iterations ($15-25)
- Decide if you want more

### 3. Read GPU Rental Guide

See **GPU_RENTAL_GUIDE.md** for complete instructions on:
- Which platform to use (Vast.ai vs RunPod vs Lambda)
- How to set up the environment
- How to start training on GPU
- How to monitor training
- How to download checkpoints

## FAQ

### Q: How do I know if it's still running?

**A:** Check the process:
```bash
ps aux | grep train_main
```

If you see a Python process, it's still running!

### Q: It's been 20 minutes and no output - is it stuck?

**A:** Probably not! Output is buffered. Check CPU usage:
```bash
top | grep python
```

If CPU is high (90-100%), it's working. Be patient!

### Q: Can I stop it?

**A:** Yes, but let it finish at least one iteration first! Press Ctrl+C or:
```bash
pkill -f "train_main.py --config mvp"
```

### Q: What if I need to leave my computer?

**A:** That's fine! The training will continue in the background. Come back in an hour and check:
```bash
cat mvp_training.log
```

### Q: My laptop went to sleep!

**A:** Training may have paused. Check if the process is still running:
```bash
ps aux | grep train_main
```

If not, just run it again - no harm done!

**Progress:** ~10% (iteration 1 of 5)
**Time remaining:** 25-55 minutes
**What to do:** Wait patiently, check back in 30 minutes

## Important Reminder

**This is a TEST run to catch bugs!**

The model trained here will be weak (only 2 games per iteration, tiny model).

**The purpose is to verify:**
- ‚úÖ Code works end-to-end
- ‚úÖ No crashes
- ‚úÖ Training loop functions correctly
- ‚úÖ You can safely spend money on GPU training

**Don't expect good play from this model!** It's just for testing.

The REAL training will happen on GPU with:
- 100 games per iteration (vs 2 now)
- 800 MCTS simulations (vs 25 now)
- Larger model (128 channels vs 32 now)
- Much faster (minutes vs hours per iteration)

**Sit back, relax, and let it run! ‚òï**

Check back in 30-60 minutes to see the results!
