## Game Rules (Quick Reference)

### Objective
- **Defenders**: Get king to any corner OR form unbreakable edge fort
- **Attackers**: Capture the king

### Movement
- All pieces move like rooks (straight lines, any distance)
- Cannot jump over pieces
- Only king can land on throne/corners

### Capture
- **Standard**: Sandwich enemy between two pieces
- **Shieldwall**: Capture multiple pieces along edge by bracketing both ends
- **King**: Requires 4-sided surround (3-sided if next to throne)
- **King is immune on board edge!**

### Special Rules
- Throne and corners count as hostile squares for captures
- Pieces can pass through empty throne
- King cannot be captured on edge
- Repetition = attacker win
