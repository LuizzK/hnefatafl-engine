    Algorithm for detecting unbreakable edge fort:
    1. Verify king is on board edge (row 0, 10, or col 0, 10)
    2. Verify king has at least one legal move
    3. Check if formation is unbreakable:

       For each possible attacker move sequence:
       - Can attackers capture the king?
       - Can attackers force king away from edge?
       - Can attackers capture all supporting defenders?

       If answer to all is NO â†’ unbreakable fort

    Since checking all move sequences is expensive, use pattern recognition:
    - Check if king is in corner-adjacent position (very strong)
    - Check if defenders form protective patterns (Tower, L-shape, etc.)
    - Verify no line formations vulnerable to shieldwall
    - Check that all defenders are protected
    - Verify king has safe moves along edge

    This is a complex minimax-like problem. For strong play, the engine
    should learn edge fort patterns through self-play rather than
    hard-coding all patterns.
